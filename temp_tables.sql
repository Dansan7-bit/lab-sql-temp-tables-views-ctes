--1) Step 1: Create a View 
--First, create a view that summarizes rental information for each customer.
--The view should include the customer's ID, name, email address, and total number of rentals (rental_count).

CREATE VIEW customer_rental_summary AS
SELECT 
c.customer_id,
CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS customer_name,
c.email,
COUNT(*) AS rental_count
FROM 
customer AS c
JOIN rental AS r ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
GROUP BY 
c.customer_id
ORDER BY 
rental_count DESC;

--2) Create a Temporary Table
-- Next, create a Temporary Table that calculates the total amount paid by each customer (total_paid).
-- The Temporary Table should use the rental summary view created in Step 1 to join with the payment table and calculate the total amount paid by each customer.

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE customer_payment_summary AS (
SELECT 
crs.customer_id,
SUM(p.amount) AS total_paid
FROM 
customer_rental_summary AS crs
JOIN rental AS r ON crs.customer_id = r.customer_id
JOIN payment AS p ON r.rental_id = p.rental_id
GROUP BY 
crs.customer_id
);


--3) Create a CTE and the Customer Summary Report
--Create a CTE that joins the rental summary View with the customer payment summary Temporary Table created in Step 2.
--The CTE should include the customer's name, email address, rental count, and total amount paid.

--Next, using the CTE, create the query to generate the final customer summary report,
--which should include: customer name, email, rental_count, total_paid and average_payment_per_rental,
--this last column is a derived column from total_paid and rental_count.

WITH customer_summary_report AS(
SELECT 
crs.customer_name,
crs.email,
crs.rental_count,
cps.total_paid
FROM 
customer_rental_summary AS crs
JOIN customer_payment_summary AS cps ON crs.customer_id = cps.customer_id)
SELECT 
*,
total_paid / rental_count AS average_payment_per_rental
FROM 
customer_summary_report
ORDER BY 
rental_count DESC;
